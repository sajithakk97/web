    <p>The<b>Taj Mahal</b><bdo dir="rtl">(taj mahal)</bdo>  is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, 
        Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth <abbr title="The Mughal Empire was an early 
        modern empire in South Asia">Mughal emperor,</abbr>  
        <i>Shah Jahan </i> to house the tomb of his beloved wife,<strong><mark>Mumtaz Mahal</mark></strong> ; it also<em> houses the tomb of Shah Jahan</em>
        himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest
        house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p>
    <p>The name "Taj Mahal" is of <del>arabic</del><ins>Urdu </ins> origin, and believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words 
        tāj mahall meaning "crown" <small>(tāj) </small>"palace" (mahall).<sup>[4][5][6]</sup> Abdul Hamid Lahori, in his book 
        from 1636 Padshahnama, refers to the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, rawdah-i munawwarah),
        meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.<sub>[7]</sub> The name "Taj" might have been derived from the 
        corruption of the second syllable of "Mumtaz".<sup>[8][9]</sup></p>
    <p>Here is some site says that</p>
    <blockquote> The Taj Mahal -- Agra's and probably India's most celebrated
        monument -- might be the only building in the world that has managed to materialize and give shape to a
         glorious love story</blockquote>
    <q>The Taj Mahal, the most prominent monument of India, stands as a timeless symbol of love</q><br><br>
